README
I completed 6/6 steps here. I chose to push when I changed an aspect of the project,
as in when I changed the size, ect., so there wasn't too many pushes and if anyone else
was working on it with me they would know  whole step was completed and what that meant
as opposed to random pushes just saying I created a list for a certain part, because I 
think the pushes would have been too close together at that point. This left me with 6
pushes in the project. I feel like I could have added a bit more to maybe explain some 
more things I changed as they were happening, I'm not sure. Because of projects in the 
past I did not have any troubles with GitHub fortunately, and the assignment wasn’t bad 
because I have seen this little dancing goblin a couple times now over my 2 years here.
